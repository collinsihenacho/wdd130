            <h2>History</h2> 
            <div class="history">
                
            <p><b>Dry Oar</b> Water Rafting Company was born out of a deep respect for<br>
                 Nigeriaâ€™s unique waterways and the life they support. Launched in 2022<br>
                on the Usuma Riverâ€”an essential tributary that winds through the Guinea <br>
                savanna just beyond Abujaâ€™s city limitsâ€”the company has always seen <br>itself
                as both adventurer and guardian. From the rustling stands of <br>ribbon reed and
                the gallery forests along its banks to the seasonal <br>migrations of fish and
                waterfowl, the Usumaâ€™s rhythms define every <br>Dray Oar excursion. In a country
                where water scarcity and pollution<br> increasingly threaten local ecosystems,
                Dray Oarâ€™s founders made a<br> conscious choice: to blend whiteâ€‘water sport with
                environmental<br> stewardship. Every raft trip doubles as a chance to monitor river<br>
                healthâ€”checking clarity, bank erosion, and wildlife sightingsâ€”and to<br> partner with
                nearby communities in cleanâ€‘up efforts and treeâ€‘planting days.<br> Local guides share 
                traditional ecological knowledge, teaching guests<br> how the riverâ€™s flood pulses sustain
                downstream farms and refill wells during the<br> dry season. By crafting custom trips that highlight both the <br>
                thrills of rapid paddling and the subtle beauty of riparian habitats,<br> Dray Oar aims to spark a lasting commitment to conservation. <br>
                Whether navigating a gentle bend or challenging Class it rapids,<br> paddlers learn how Nigeriaâ€™s waterways connect to broader landscapesâ€”and <br>
                why protecting them matters not just for adventure but for the <br>future of every village and city that depends on these lifelines.

            <h3> Dry Oar Water Rafting Company was founded in 2022 by outdoor<br>
                enthusiast and riverâ€‘rafting expert Collins Ihenacho. Fueled by<br>
                a love of tourism, community engagement, and the pure thrill<br>
                of sport on the water, Collins set out to create more than just<br>
                whiteâ€‘water excursionsâ€”he envisioned custom trips that bring<br>
                people together, uplift local neighborhoods, and celebrate the wild<br>
                beauty of the Usuma River in Abuja. In its inaugural season, Dray<br>
                Oar launched with a single tailorâ€‘built raft and a small crew of<br>
                passionate guides, carefully navigating the gentle rapids and<br>
                hidden eddies of the Usumaâ€™s winding course. From day one the companyâ€™s<br>
                unwavering commitment to safety, bespoke customer service, and respectful<br>
                stewardship of the riverbank communities has earned Dray Oar a growing base<br>
                of loyal adventurers and a sterling reputation in Abujaâ€™s outdoor tourism scene.</h3>

            <p> Dry Oar quickly grew beyond the Usuma River, adding premier stretches at Gurara Falls, the Kaduna near Kafanchan, Lokojaâ€™s Niger rapids and Makurdiâ€™s Benue channelsâ€”each chosen for its scenery and paddleâ€‘ready thrills.
                From the start the company paired adventure with stewardship: biodegradable gear, solarâ€‘powered camps, regular river cleanâ€‘ups and treeâ€‘planting drives led by local guides sharing traditional floodâ€‘pulse wisdom. In 2024, 
                Dry Oar rolled out recycledâ€‘composite rafts, rigorous safety standards and its own swiftâ€‘water rescue academyâ€”ensuring every trip blends excitement with ecological care.
                Today, Dry Oar stands as Nigeriaâ€™s benchmark for whiteâ€‘water tourism, inspiring paddlers to chase rapids and champion the waterways that sustain communities from Abuja to the Niger delta.</p>
